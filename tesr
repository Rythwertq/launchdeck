# Couldn't find any recognized files or folders. We look files indicative 
# of package managers or frameworks, for example "package.json" or 
# "composer.json". Are we missing something? Please let us know!
# Here's an example configuration to get you started:

# Add commands that will run in your repository in an isolated container
# during the build phase:
build:
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install openssh-server
  - cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  - echo LOL!

# Add paths to delete once the build completes (uncomment these lines 
# to use "purge")
# purge:
#  - node_modules
